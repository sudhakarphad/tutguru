* template strings is same like string datatype see the below use:

let fullName: string = `Bob Bobbington`;
let sentence: string = `Hello, my name is ${ fullName }.

I'll be ${ age + 1 } years old next month.`;	

equals to :
let sentence: string = "Hello, my name is " + fullName + ".\n\n" +
    "I'll be " + (age + 1) + " years old next month.";
